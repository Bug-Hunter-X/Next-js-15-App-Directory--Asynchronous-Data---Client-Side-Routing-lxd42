In Next.js 15, issues can arise with the introduction of the `app` directory and its new routing system. One uncommon error stems from incorrectly handling asynchronous data fetching within `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` when used alongside the `app` directory.  These functions might try to access data that hasn't fully loaded, resulting in undefined values or errors in components.  Another less obvious issue can surface when attempting to use client-side routing techniques within `app` directory pages. Since these pages are server-side rendered by default,  client-side navigation may not work as expected, leading to unexpected behavior or page refreshes.
