To resolve the asynchronous data fetching problem, ensure that data fetching is complete before rendering the page. This might involve using `async/await` and properly handling the loading state. Client-side routing issues can be solved by utilizing Next.js's built-in navigation methods (`router.push`, etc.) or carefully designing the page interactions to avoid direct manipulation of URLs.  For robust data handling, consider using a state management solution like Zustand or Redux.  Always validate that data has been successfully fetched before using it within the component's JSX.
