This repository demonstrates two uncommon bugs that can occur in Next.js 15's `app` directory: 1. Issues with asynchronous data fetching within `getServerSideProps`/`getStaticProps`, and 2. Unexpected behavior when using client-side routing techniques.  The `app-async-data-bug.js` file shows the problematic code. `app-async-data-solution.js` provides a corrected implementation addressing both issues.
